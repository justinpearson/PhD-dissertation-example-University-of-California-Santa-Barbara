\label{chap:preemption}


In this chapter we consider the problem of stabilizing a system with unpredictable timing due to the controller running on a non-real-time operating system. 
We propose a method of implementing a discrete-time control
algorithm on a non-real-time operating system so that the sensing
and actuation occur at precise times, even if the OS preempts the
control task.


\section{Real-time I/O coprocessor concept}
\label{sec:rtiop} 


We first describe the architecture of our control and
sensing/actuation scheme. Figure~\ref{fig:bbb-schematic} illustrates
the basic idea, which is that the controller and sensor/actuator
execute on two separate processors.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this chapter, we presented a controls architecture that pairs a
\rtio{} with a controller on a non-real-time operating system. The
\RTU{} enables sampling and actuation at precise times, even when the
controller is preempted by the OS. This enables control designers to
reap the benefits of an OS with minimal concern for the timing
uncertainties associated with the OS task scheduler.
